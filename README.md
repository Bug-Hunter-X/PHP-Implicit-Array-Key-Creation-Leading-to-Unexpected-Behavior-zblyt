This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to implicit array key creation.  When you access an array element with a key that doesn't exist, PHP implicitly creates that key with a default value, which can lead to unforeseen consequences in your code's logic.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.php` offers a solution to prevent this type of error.
