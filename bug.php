In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

echo $myArray[0]; // Notice the implicit key 0
?>
```

While you might expect this to output nothing (or a notice), PHP implicitly creates the key `0` with a value of "" (empty string).  This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when iterating through the array or relying on a specific key order.  The issue stems from PHP's loose type system, which silently handles this key creation without raising warnings unless explicitly configured.
